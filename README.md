# Super Sunshakes Fly Mod
**The Ultimate Fly Mod, Themed Around Sunshakes! Of all colors! Speed up, slow down, and FLY!**
<br />
<br />
<br />
**How to use:**
Put the shakes in your hotbar. Click while holding to drink. Hold F to place down shake. You can use the part and it will apply effects as well.

FlyShake - Toggle fly mode. <br />
SpeedShake - Speed up to 4x normal speed. <br />
SlowShake - Slow down to half speed. <br />
ResetShake - Return speed back to normal. <br />
TurboShake - Supercharge speed to 10x normal. <br />

*When toggling fly mode, your speed effects reset.*
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also a few commands you can use instead: <br />
/fly - Toggles fly mode. <br />
/speed (multiplier) - Sets your speed multiplier to the inputted number. Decimals do work. 1 for default, 2 for double, 3 triple, etc. Setting it negative reverses your movement! <br />
/shakeAlertText (true/false) - Toggles the text that appears on the top of your screen when using shakes or commands. Saves between worlds. <br />
