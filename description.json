   "description" : "Commands Update (Nov 7th, 2024, 1.3)\nAdded a few commands. More information below.\nAdded a failsafe for picking up chests with items or other objects that you would \"carry\" instead of hold in hotbar. Before, you would be stuck in fly mode. Now, it automatically disables fly mode for you.\n\n\nSuper Sunshakes! Of all colors! Speed up, slow down, and FLY!\n\nHow to use:\nPut the shakes in your hotbar. Click while holding to drink. Hold F to place down part. You can use the part and it will apply effects as well.\n\nFlyShake - Toggle fly mode.\nSpeedShake - Speed up to 4x normal speed.\nSlowShake - Slow down to half speed.\nResetShake - Return speed back to normal.\nTurboShake - Supercharge speed to 10x normal.\n\nWhen toggling fly mode, your speed effects reset.\n\nThere are also a few commands you can use instead:\n/fly - Toggles fly mode.\n/speed (multipier) - Sets your speed multiplier to the inputted number. Decimals do work. 1 for default, 2 for double, 3 triple, etc. Setting it negative reverses your movement!\n/shakeAlertText (true/false) - Toggles the text that appears on the top of your screen when using shakes or commands. Saves between worlds.",
