[b]WARNING FOR ANYONE WHO USES 00FANT'S TOOLS MOD:

His "Advanced" Tools mod will constantly reset player speed multiplier, so speed effects in this mod won't work. I cannot fix this myself, and after asking 00Fant to change this, he said nothing, blocked me, and banned me from his discord for seemingly no reason. (Other than I pointed out a flaw in his mod, and he is too narcissistic to fix it, and says its someone else's fault.) Try disabling his mod and look for alternatives, such as this mod and Ben Bingo's Block and Part Editor. I do plan to introduce all of the missing tools from his mod into this one, such as a cosmic SunShake™ as a gravity gun, and a paint bucket SunShake™, to paint whole creations or bodies.[/b]

When holding your force build key, (usually F) you can place down any Super SunShake™ you want besides SilverShake™. You can then directly drink these physical shakes instead of using a tool. You can also see all the details on the cool new textures this way, such as the ingredients list and QR code.
Fun fact: These placeable versions used to be the ONLY way to use the mod. You were required to place one down and then use it. I later changed it in the 1.0 update, which introduced tool variations, although they had no visuals at all and were very primitive.

[h3]There are also a few commands you can use instead:[/h3]

[b]/fly[/b] - Toggles fly mode.
[b]/speed[/b] (multipier) - Sets your speed multiplier to the inputted number. Decimals do work. 1 for default, 2 for double, 3 triple, etc. Setting it negative reverses your movement, setting it to 0 locks you in place.
