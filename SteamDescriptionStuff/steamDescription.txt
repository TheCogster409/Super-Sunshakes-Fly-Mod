[b]WARNING FOR ANYONE WHO USES 00FANT'S TOOLS MOD:

His "Advanced" Tools mod will constantly reset player speed multiplier, so speed effects in this mod won't work. I cannot fix this myself, and after asking 00Fant to change this, he said nothing, blocked me, and banned me from his discord for seemingly no reason. (Other than I pointed out a flaw in his mod, and he is too narcissistic to fix it, and says its someone else's fault.) Try disabling his mod and look for alternatives, such as this mod and Ben Bingo's Block and Part Editor.[/b]

[b]2.1 Update:[/b] [i](Jun 1st, 2025, 2.0)[/i]
SilverShake™ now is ONLY used to open the mod settings menu.
FlyShake™ multitool - the FLyShake™ now can be used as a combonation of the other speed shakes with 2 new keybinds. You can now speed up to 4x speed using this shake. However it cannot go as fast as the TurboShake™. This is meant to reduce the inventory space for this mod to 1 slot.
There is a new keybind for all shakes besides SilverShake™ and ResetShake™ that allows you to reset speed without needing a ResetShake™ in your hotbar.
Because this was a quick update the gifs in the description have not been updated.

You can also press Q and R to speedup and reset speed, which basically makes this one item the only one needed in the hotbar.

When holding your force build key, (usually F) you can place down any Super SunShake™ you want besides SilverShake™. You can then directly drink these physical shakes instead of using a tool. You can also see all the details on the cool new textures this way, such as the ingredients list and QR code.
Fun fact: These placeable versions used to be the ONLY way to use the mod. You were required to place one down and then use it. I later changed it in the 1.0 update, which introduced tool variations, although they had no visuals at all and were very primitive.

[h3]There are also a few commands you can use instead:[/h3]

[b]/fly[/b] - Toggles fly mode.
[b]/speed (multipier)[/b] - Sets your speed multiplier to the inputted number. Decimals do work. 1 for default, 2 for double, 3 triple, etc. Setting it negative reverses your movement, setting it to 0 locks you in place.
