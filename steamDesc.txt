[i]Previous patch notes in the changelog tab at the top, beside comments.[/i]

[b]edit: this update below isnt out yet. There were some multiplayer problems, but I don't want to redo description later.[/b]
[b]A bit of everything update:[/b] [i](Dec 10th, 2024, 1.4)[/i]
New command added - Look below
Speed is now preserved when toggling fly mode.
Shakes now share one common script - Internal change, doesn't affect normal game.
Diving - Up/Down speed is now affected by the speed shakes.
Preserved fly and speed - Fly mode and speed factor are both now preserved when leaving and rejoining a world.
Updated alert text to make more sense - Before, going from Turbo to Speed said you gained speed, when that wasn't true. See the updated alert text here:

Increase speed:
"fly" : "Your inner woc defies gravity..."
"speed" : "The SpeedShake™ charges up the inner Woc inside you...",
"slow" : "The SlowShake™ charges your up your inner woc, but it still isn't strong...",
"turbo" : "The TurboShake™ charges up your inner Woc to extreme levels...",

Decrease speed:
"fly" : "Your inner woc obeys Newton...",
"speed" : "The SpeedShake™ calms your inner woc down, but not fully...",
"slow" : "The SlowShake™ discharges your inner Woc beyond comprehension...",
"turbo" : "The TurboShake™ dampens your inner woc, but it is still highly active...",

Other:
"reset" : "The ResetShake™ returns your inner Woc to normal levels..."
"blank" : "Nothing happens...." (this is when you use a shake twice in a row)

[h1]Super Sunshakes! Of all colors! Speed up, slow down, and FLY![/h1]

How to use:
Put the shakes in your hotbar. Click while holding to drink. Hold F to place down part. You can use the shake and it will apply effects as well.

FlyShake - Toggle fly mode.
SpeedShake - Speed up to 4x normal speed.
SlowShake - Slow down to half speed.
ResetShake - Return speed back to normal.
TurboShake - Supercharge speed to 10x normal.

[i]Note: When toggling fly mode, your speed effects reset.[/i]



There are also a few commands you can use instead:
[b]/fly[/b] - Toggles fly mode.
[b]/speed[/b] (multipier) - Sets your speed multiplier to the inputted number. Decimals do work. 1 for default, 2 for double, 3 triple, etc. Setting it negative reverses your movement!
[b]/shakeAlertText[/b] (true/false) - Toggles the text that appears on the top of your screen when using shakes or commands. Saves between worlds.
[b]/flyMode[/b] (normal/swim/dive) - Normal is what you usually want, with up/down speed affected. Swim is what was before this update, without any particles, good for recording. Dive is glitchy but it is there, idk what it really does.
