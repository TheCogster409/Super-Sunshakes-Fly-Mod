            <Property key="Caption" value="You have 00Fant&apos;s &quot;Advanced&quot; Tools mod installed and loaded in this world. This causes the speed effects of this mod to be reset constantly\nand basically ineffective. I cannot fix this. I have messaged 00Fant asking him to fix this in his mod. He did not respond and instead blocked\nand banned me from his Discord server. There is no way for me to get him to fix his mod. Please note that this problem is not caused by my \nmod; 00Fant&apos;s mod is the culprit, as it is the one that resets speed effects.\n\nBasically his mod is coded like crap and messes up mine.\n\nIn additon, 00Fant is also a very mean and toxic person, as he always thinks of himself first and that his mods are the only ones that matter.\n\nHere are some alternative mods that add all the features of Advanced Tools:\nSuper SunShakes™ Fly Mod - Flight, obviously.\nBingo&apos;s Block and Part Editor - A more complete block editor, with full JSON editing for even more functionality.\nMT Fast Logic - A very advanced mod with a ton of features and an even more complex multiconnection system, tensor connect.\nHexInk Color Ammo - Doesn&apos;t have all the features of the Paint Bucket, but you can still choose from all 16,777,216 possible colors.\nThe Gravity Gun and Measurement Tool don&apos;t really have alternatives, but I don&apos;t know anyone who actually uses them often anyway.\n\n Thanks for using my mod!
